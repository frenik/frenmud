	Worked on login system. Program now loads users from a file and properly 
password checks. May want to add encryption to passwords. Added a player level
and several commands: "quit", "level", "say". Created World class, at least the
shell. Needs to be fleshed out, does absolutely nothing and has hooks nowhere
right now. That's next on the agenda.

	Program is getting kind of long for one file, but I'm going to keep it that
way until I decide to split it up. I need to figure out how Python does this.

	I also started several log files for myself. "bugs.txt" is for keeping track
of bugs that I notice but don't NEED to fix (opting instead to work on some
functionality or something). "todo.txt" is for keeping track of ideas and work
flow over sessions, and "notes.txt" is this file, for keeping track of what I've
done so far and my thoughts/plans going forward.

	I've been this far before, nothing special. But this time I'm determined to 
make it work. Stupid mud servers. 

	So far it seems to be stable enough. A few crashes.

	Added a shutdown function to the Server class, Server.terminate(). Sends a 
message to all client sockets before closing them, then closes the connection.
For now the function will only be called upon the variable Server.shutdown being
set to true (therefore exiting the main loop), or catching a KeyboardInterrupt I
put on server.serve() in main().

	Tested it, seems to work fine. Exactly as expected. Love python.
	
	Last night I set up a google projects repository for "frenik-mud". Name's 
change but it was more of a test than anything. Next time I get a good internet 
day I'll start uploading to the git repo.

	Added Player.appendOutbuf(self, c), where c is the string to be appended. Not
going to go through and make other code use it yet, going to make sure it's the 
right way to do it first.
